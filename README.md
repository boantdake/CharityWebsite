This project first off was a blast to do. These ladies I have been volunteering for for the last few years delivering food, presents and clothing for those less fortunate in Anderson County, TN. When I was asked to make a website for them that is more than a simple copy and paste of their schedule I was thrilled to do so. Ms. Susan worked with me directly to get this project finished it can be viewed directly here Anderson Community Action .
